# ScaLER

Scalable testing of logical error rate for QEC circuit. 




## TODO

- [ ] Support installation via `pip install`
- [ ] Add cross-platform installation support (including macOS)
- [ ] Write full documentation
- [ ] Implement dynamic-circuit support(Compatible with IBM)
- [ ] Higher-level, easier interface to generate QEC program
- [ ] Support testing code switching
- [ ] Add more noise models
- [ ] Support injecting quantum errors by type
- [ ] Add CUDA backend support

# Environment and compilation


<!-- > [!IMPORTANT]
> Be careful about setting up environment -->

The code is developed in C++17. 


We are using dynamic bitset from boost, to install it, run:

```bash
choco install   boost-msvc-14.3 -y
```

The boost header file will be stored under the path "C:\local\boost_1_87_0\boost". Add this path into VScode cpp include path. 



We also use vcpkg and install the Eigen3 library for matrix operations.


We use pybind11 to convert the samples from C++ objects to python objects. To install using vcpkg, run the following command:

```bash
vcpkg install pybind11
```

Also need to add the path of the python header file

```bash
py -c "from sysconfig import get_paths as gp; print(gp()['include'])"
```

Run the following command to build the QEPG package with pybinding:

```bash
py setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

Run the following command to clear the previously compiled output:

```bash
py setup.py clean --all    
```


We also need to convert C++ object to python object directly. So "Python.h" needs to be added to the search path. Typically, it is under:


```bash
C:\Users\username\miniconda3\include
```


# How to compile run python script


To compile QEPG python package by pybind11:

```bash
(Under QEPG folder)./compilepybind.ps1
```

The python code is divided into different modules. For example, to run the test_by_stim.py file under test module, stay at the root folder and execute:

```bash
(Under Sampling folder)py -m test.test_by_stim   
```

# How to run tests?


All test script are kept under test/ folder. You can test the correct ness of our QEPG implementation, test with ground truth for small scale circuit. 





# How to run benchmark circuit and reproduce the table?

All our benchmark circuit are stored undered stimprograms/ folder. To reproduce one circuit, for example, for surface code with distance 7, execute the following python script:



```python
from ScaLER import stratified_Scurve_LERcalc
d=7
p = 0.001
repeat=5
sample_budget = 100_000_0000
t = (d - 1) // 2
stim_path = f"your/path/stimprograms/surface/surface7"
figname = f"Surface{d}"
titlename = f"Surface{d}"
output_filename = f"Surface{d}.txt"
testinstance = stratified_Scurve_LERcalc(p, sampleBudget=sample_budget, k_range=5, num_subspace=6, beta=4)
testinstance.set_t(t)
testinstance.set_sample_bound(
    MIN_NUM_LE_EVENT=100,
    SAMPLE_GAP=100,
    MAX_SAMPLE_GAP=5000,
    MAX_SUBSPACE_SAMPLE=50000
)
with open(output_filename, "w") as f:
    with redirect_stdout(f):
        testinstance.calculate_LER_from_file(stim_path, p, 0, figname, titlename, repeat)
```



# Symbolic calculator of LER

In this part, I explain how to get the ground truth of logical error rate by Symbolic calculator. Reader can reproduce Table 2



```python
from ScaLER.stratifiedScurve import stratified_Scurve_LERcalc
from contextlib import redirect_stdout
from ScaLER.symbolicLER import symbolicLER


if __name__ == "__main__":

    testinstance=symbolicLER(0.001)
    filepath="your/file/path/to/circuit"
    print(testinstance.calculate_LER_from_file(filepath,0.001))
    p=0.001

    num_noise=testinstance._num_noise

    for weight in range(1,num_noise):
        print("LER in the subspace {} is {}".format(weight,testinstance.evaluate_LER_subspace(p,weight)))        


    for weight in range(1,num_noise):
        print("SubspaceLER {} is {}".format(weight,testinstance.subspace_LER(weight)))     
```




# Use Monte random fault injection we implemeted to test any circuit

In this part, I explain how to test any circuit with the widely use random fault injection method.



```python
from contextlib import redirect_stdout
from ScaLER.stimLER import stimLERcalc

if __name__ == "__main__":


    p=0.001
    filepath="C:/Users/username/Documents/ScaLER/stimprograms/surface/surface3"
    d=3
    repeat=5
    sampleBudget=500000
    # 3) build your output filename:
    out_fname ="resultMonte.txt"     # e.g. "surface3-result.txt"
    # 4) redirect prints for just this file:

    with open(out_fname, "w") as outf, redirect_stdout(outf):

        calculator=stimLERcalc(MIN_NUM_LE_EVENT=10)
        # pass the string path into your function:
        ler = calculator.calculate_LER_from_my_random_sampler(sampleBudget,filepath, p, repeat)    
```


# Use Stim and Sinter to test any circuit


You can also test the circuit with Stim optimized by Sinter. 


```python
from contextlib import redirect_stdout
from ScaLER.stimLER import stimLERcalc

if __name__ == "__main__":


    p=0.001
    filepath=f"your/path/stimprograms/surface/surface7"
    d=3
    repeat=5
    sampleBudget=500000
    # 3) build your output filename:
    out_fname ="resultSinter.txt"     # e.g. "surface3-result.txt"
    # 4) redirect prints for just this file:

    with open(out_fname, "w") as outf, redirect_stdout(outf):

        calculator=stimLERcalc(MIN_NUM_LE_EVENT=10)
        # pass the string path into your function:   
        ler  = calculator.calculate_LER_from_file_sinter(sampleBudget,filepath, p, repeat)
```


# Use ScaLER to test any circuit

In this part, I explain how to use ScaLER to test and input circuit. I will explain how to change hyper parameters. In a python script, run the folloing code:


```python
from ScaLER.stratifiedScurve import stratified_Scurve_LERcalc
from contextlib import redirect_stdout

if __name__ == "__main__":

    d=7
    p = 0.001
    repeat=5
    sample_budget = 100_000_0000
    t = (d - 1) // 2
    stim_path = f"Relative/Path/ScaLER/stimprograms/surface/surface{d}"
    figname = f"Surface{d}"
    titlename = f"Surface{d}"
    output_filename = f"Surface{d}.txt"
    testinstance = stratified_Scurve_LERcalc(p, sampleBudget=sample_budget, k_range=5, num_subspace=6, beta=4)
    testinstance.set_t(t)
    testinstance.set_sample_bound(
        MIN_NUM_LE_EVENT=100,
        SAMPLE_GAP=100,
        MAX_SAMPLE_GAP=5000,
        MAX_SUBSPACE_SAMPLE=50000
    )
    with open(output_filename, "w") as f:
        with redirect_stdout(f):
            testinstance.calculate_LER_from_file(stim_path, p, 0, figname, titlename, repeat)
```

Under the same directory, you will see a output figure which shows the fitted curve, and a output.txt file which shows all results.
